### Info
These scripts are mainly for my personal use, as they fit my use cases with my webhook and such. That being said these scripts are very good for sending data to any sort of webhook (discord included).
If you want infohacking scripts for data of all sorts that are easy to customize then this is what you're looking for.
I won't provide super detailed info on them in this readme unless someone asks as like I said these are mainly for my own use.
